CONTRIBUTING
============
Do you want to contribute to `cheat`? There are a few ways to help:

#### Submit a cheatsheet ####
Do you have a witty bash one-liner to share? [Open a pull-request][pr] against
the [cheatsheets][] repository. (The `cheat` executable source code lives in
[cheat/cheat][cheat]. Cheatsheet content lives in
[cheat/cheatsheets][cheatsheets].)

#### Report a bug ####
Did you find a bug? Report it in the [issue tracker][issues]. (But before you
do, please look through the open issues to make sure that it hasn't already
 been reported.)

#### Add a feature ####
Do you have a feature that you'd like to contribute? Propose it in the [issue
tracker][issues] to discuss with the maintainer whether it would be considered
for merging.

`cheat` is mostly mature and feature-complete, but may still have some room for
new features.

#### Add documentation ####
Did you encounter features, bugs, edge-cases, use-cases, or environment
considerations that were undocumented or under-documented? Add them to the
[wiki][]. (You may also open a pull-request against the `README`, if
appropriate.)

Do you enjoy technical writing or proofreading? Help keep the documentation
error-free and well-organized.

#### Spread the word ####
Are you unable to do the above, but still want to contribute? You can help
`cheat` simply by telling others about it. Share it with friends and coworkers
that might benefit from using it.
