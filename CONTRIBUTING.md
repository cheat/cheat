# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in `cheat`.

Pull requests are no longer being accepted, and have been disabled on this
repository. The maintainer is not currently reviewing or merging external code
contributions.

Bug reports are still welcome. If you've found a bug, please open an issue in
the [issue tracker][issues]. Before doing so, please search through the
existing open issues to make sure it hasn't already been reported.

Feature requests may be filed, but are unlikely to be implemented. The project
is now mature and the maintainer considers its feature set to be essentially
complete.
