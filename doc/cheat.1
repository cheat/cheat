.SH FILES
.SS Configuration
\f[B]cheat\f[R] is configured via a YAML file that is conventionally
named \f[I]conf.yaml\f[R].
\f[B]cheat\f[R] will search for \f[I]conf.yaml\f[R] in varying
locations, depending upon your platform:
.SS Linux, OSX, and other Unixes
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R]/cheat/conf.yaml
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]$HOME\f[R]/.config/cheat/conf.yml
.IP "4." 3
\f[B]$HOME\f[R]/.cheat/conf.yml
.SS Windows
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]APPDATA\f[R]/cheat/conf.yml
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]PROGRAMDATA\f[R]/cheat/conf.yml
.PP
\f[B]cheat\f[R] will search in the order specified above.
The first \f[I]conf.yaml\f[R] encountered will be respected.
.PP
If \f[B]cheat\f[R] cannot locate a config file, it will ask if you\[cq]d
like to generate one automatically.
Alternatively, you may also generate a config file manually by running
\f[B]cheat \[en]init\f[R] and saving its output to the appropriate
location for your platform.
.SS Cheatpaths
\f[B]cheat\f[R] reads its cheatsheets from \[lq]cheatpaths\[rq], which
are the directories in which cheatsheets are stored.
Cheatpaths may be configured in \f[I]conf.yaml\f[R], and viewed via
\f[B]cheat \-d\f[R].
.PP
For detailed instructions on how to configure cheatpaths, please refer
to the comments in conf.yml.
.SS Autocompletion
\f[B]cheat\f[R] can generate shell completion scripts for
\f[B]bash\f[R], \f[B]zsh\f[R], \f[B]fish\f[R], and \f[B]powershell\f[R]
via the \f[B]\[en]completion\f[R] flag:
.IP
.EX
cheat \-\-completion bash
cheat \-\-completion zsh
cheat \-\-completion fish
cheat \-\-completion powershell
.EE
.PP
Completions are dynamically generated and include cheatsheet names,
tags, and cheatpath names.
.PP
To install completions, pipe the output to the appropriate location for
your shell.
For example, on \f[B]bash\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
cheat \-\-completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/cheat
.EE
.PP
Or for the current user only:
.IP
.EX
cheat \-\-completion bash > \[ti]/.local/share/bash\-completion/completions/cheat
.EE
.PP
For \f[B]zsh\f[R], you may need to add the completions directory to your
\f[B]fpath\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
cheat \-\-completion zsh > \[dq]${fpath[1]}/_cheat\[dq]
.EE
.PP
For \f[B]fish\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
cheat \-\-completion fish > \[ti]/.config/fish/completions/cheat.fish
.EE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[R]
The path at which the config file is available.
If \f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[R] is set, all other config paths will be
ignored.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.IP "0." 3
Successful termination
.IP "1." 3
Application error
.IP "2." 3
Cheatsheet(s) not found
