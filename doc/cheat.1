.SH FILES
.SS Configuration
\f[B]cheat\f[R] is configured via a YAML file that is conventionally
named \f[I]conf.yaml\f[R].
\f[B]cheat\f[R] will search for \f[I]conf.yaml\f[R] in varying
locations, depending upon your platform:
.SS Linux, OSX, and other Unixes
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R]/cheat/conf.yaml
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]$HOME\f[R]/.config/cheat/conf.yml
.IP "4." 3
\f[B]$HOME\f[R]/.cheat/conf.yml
.SS Windows
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]APPDATA\f[R]/cheat/conf.yml
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]PROGRAMDATA\f[R]/cheat/conf.yml
.PP
\f[B]cheat\f[R] will search in the order specified above.
The first \f[I]conf.yaml\f[R] encountered will be respected.
.PP
If \f[B]cheat\f[R] cannot locate a config file, it will ask if you\[cq]d
like to generate one automatically.
Alternatively, you may also generate a config file manually by running
\f[B]cheat \[en]init\f[R] and saving its output to the appropriate
location for your platform.
.SS Cheatpaths
\f[B]cheat\f[R] reads its cheatsheets from \[lq]cheatpaths\[rq], which
are the directories in which cheatsheets are stored.
Cheatpaths may be configured in \f[I]conf.yaml\f[R], and viewed via
\f[B]cheat \-d\f[R].
.PP
For detailed instructions on how to configure cheatpaths, please refer
to the comments in conf.yml.

The installation process will vary per system and shell configuration,
and thus will not be discussed here.
