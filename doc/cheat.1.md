remember.

: List cheatsheet directories.

-e, \--edit=_CHEATSHEET_
: Open _CHEATSHEET_ for editing.

-l, \--list
: List available cheatsheets.

-p, \--path=_PATH_
: Filter only to sheets found on path _PATH_.

-r, \--regex
: Treat search _PHRASE_ as a regular expression.

-s, \--search=_PHRASE_
: Search cheatsheets for _PHRASE_.

-t, \--tag=_TAG_
: Filter only to sheets tagged with _TAG_.

-T, \--tags
: List all tags in use.

-v, \--version
: Print the version number.

\--rm=_CHEATSHEET_
: Remove (deletes) _CHEATSHEET_.


EXAMPLES
========

FILES
=====

Configuration
-------------
**cheat** is configured via a YAML file that is conventionally named
_conf.yaml_.  **cheat** will search for _conf.yaml_ in varying locations,
depending upon your platform:

### Linux, OSX, and other Unixes ###

1. **CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH**
2. **XDG_CONFIG_HOME**/cheat/conf.yaml
3. **$HOME**/.config/cheat/conf.yml
4. **$HOME**/.cheat/conf.yml

### Windows ###

1. **CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH**
2. **APPDATA**/cheat/conf.yml
3. **PROGRAMDATA**/cheat/conf.yml

**cheat** will search in the order specified above. The first _conf.yaml_
encountered will be respected.

If **cheat** cannot locate a config file, it will ask if you'd like to generate
one automatically. Alternatively, you may also generate a config file manually
by running **cheat \--init** and saving its output to the appropriate location
for your platform.


Cheatpaths
----------
**cheat** reads its cheatsheets from "cheatpaths", which are the directories in
which cheatsheets are stored. Cheatpaths may be configured in _conf.yaml_, and
viewed via **cheat -d**.

For detailed instructions on how to configure cheatpaths, please refer to the
comments in conf.yml.


Autocompletion
--------------
Autocompletion scripts for **bash**, **zsh**, and **fish** are available for
download:

- <https://github.com/cheat/cheat/blob/master/scripts/cheat.bash>
- <https://github.com/cheat/cheat/blob/master/scripts/cheat.fish>
- <https://github.com/cheat/cheat/blob/master/scripts/cheat.zsh>

The **bash** and **zsh** scripts provide optional integration with **fzf**, if
the latter is available on your **PATH**.

The installation process will vary per system and shell configuration, and thus
will not be discussed here.


ENVIRONMENT
===========

**CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH**

: The path at which the config file is available. If **CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH** is
set, all other config paths will be ignored.

**CHEAT_USE_FZF**

: If set, autocompletion scripts will attempt to integrate with **fzf**.

RETURN VALUES
=============

0. Successful termination

1. Application error

2. Cheatsheet(s) not found
