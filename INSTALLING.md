Installing
==========
`cheat` has no runtime dependencies. As such, installing it is generally
straightforward. There are a few methods available:

### Install manually
#### Unix-like
On Unix-like systems, you may simply paste the following snippet into your terminal:

```sh
cd /tmp \
  && wget https://github.com/cheat/cheat/releases/download/4.4.0/cheat-linux-amd64.gz \
  && gunzip cheat-linux-amd64.gz \
  && chmod +x cheat-linux-amd64 \
  && sudo mv cheat-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cheat
```

You may need to change the version number (`4.4.0`) and the archive
(`cheat-linux-amd64.gz`) depending on your platform.

See the [releases page][releases] for a list of supported platforms.

#### Windows
TODO: community support is requested here. Please open a PR if you'd like to
contribute installation instructions for Windows.

### Install via `go install`
If you have `go` version `>=1.17` available on your `PATH`, you can install
`cheat` via `go install`:

```sh
go install github.com/cheat/cheat/cmd/cheat@latest
```

### Install via package manager
Several community-maintained packages are also available:

Package manager  | Package(s)
---------------- | -----------
aur              | [cheat][pkg-aur-cheat], [cheat-bin][pkg-aur-cheat-bin]
brew             | [cheat][pkg-brew]
docker           | [docker-cheat][pkg-docker]
nix              | [nixos.cheat][pkg-nix]
snap             | [cheat][pkg-snap]

## Configuring
Three things must be done before you can use `cheat`:
1. A config file must be generated
2. [`cheatpaths`][cheatpaths] must be configured
3. [Community cheatsheets][community] must be downloaded

On first run, `cheat` will run an installer that will do all of the above
automatically. After the installer is complete, it is strongly advised that you
view the configuration file that was generated, as you may want to change some
of its default values (to enable colorization, change the paginator, etc).

### conf.yml ###
`cheat` is configured by a YAML file that will be auto-generated on first run.

By default, the config file is assumed to exist on an XDG-compliant
configuration path like `~/.config/cheat/conf.yml`. If you would like to store
it elsewhere, you may export a `CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable that
specifies its path:

```sh
export CHEAT_CONFIG_PATH="~/.dotfiles/cheat/conf.yml"
```
