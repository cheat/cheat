# The paths at which cheatsheets are available. Tags associated with a cheatpath
# are automatically attached to all cheatsheets residing on that path.
#
# Whenever cheatsheets share the same title (like 'tar'), the most local
# cheatsheets (those which come later in this file) take precedent over the
# less local sheets. This allows you to create your own "overides" for
# "upstream" cheatsheets.
#
# But what if you want to view the "upstream" cheatsheets instead of your own?
# Cheatsheets may be filtered via 'cheat -t <tag>' in combination with other
# commands. So, if you want to view the 'tar' cheatsheet that is tagged as
# 'community' rather than your own, you can use: cheat tar -t community
cheatpaths:

  # Paths that come earlier are considered to be the most "global", and will
  # thus be overridden by more local cheatsheets. That being the case, you
  # should probably list community cheatsheets first.
  #
  # Note that the paths and tags listed below are just examples. You may freely
  # change them to suit your needs.
  #
  # TODO: regarding community cheatsheets: these must be installed separately.
  # You may download them here:
  #
  # https://github.com/cheat/cheatsheets
  #
  # Once downloaded, ensure that 'path' below points to the location at which
  # you downloaded the community cheatsheets.
  - name: community
    path: ~/.config/cheat/cheatsheets/community
    tags: [ community ]
    readonly: true

  # If you have personalized cheatsheets, list them last. They will take
  # precedence over the more global cheatsheets.
  - name: personal
    path: ~/.config/cheat/cheatsheets/personal
    tags: [ personal ]
    readonly: false

  # While it requires no specific configuration here, it's also worth noting
  # that 'cheat' will automatically append directories named '.cheat' within
  # the current working directory to the 'cheatpath'. This can be very useful
  # if you'd like to closely associate cheatsheets with, for example, a
  # directory containing source code.
  #
  # Such "directory-scoped" cheatsheets will be treated as the most "local"
  # cheatsheets, and will override less "local" cheatsheets. Likewise,
  # directory-scoped cheatsheets will always be editable ('readonly: false').
