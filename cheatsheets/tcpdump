# TCPDump is a packet analyzer. It allows the user to intercept and display TCP/IP
# and other packets being transmitted or received over a network. (cf Wikipedia).
# Note: 173.194.40.120 => google.com

# Intercepts all packets on eth0
tcpdump -i eth0

# Intercepts all packets from/to 173.194.40.120
tcpdump host 173.194.40.120

# Intercepts all packets on all interfaces from / to 173.194.40.120 port 80
# -nn => Disables name resolution for IP addresses and port numbers.
tcpdump -nn -i any host 173.194.40.120 and port 80

# Make a grep on tcpdump (ASCII)
# -A  => Show only ASCII in packets.
# -s0 => By default, tcpdump only captures 68 bytes.
tcpdump -i -A any host 173.194.40.120 and port 80 | grep 'User-Agent'

# With ngrep
# -d eth0 => To force eth0 (else ngrep work on all interfaces)
# -s0 => force ngrep to look at the entire packet. (Default snaplen: 65536 bytes)
ngrep 'User-Agent' host 173.194.40.120 and port 80
