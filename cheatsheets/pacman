# You can't directly install packages from the Arch User Database (AUR) with pacman.
# You need yaourt to perform that. But considering yaourt itself is in the AUR, here is how to 
build a package from its tarball.
# First, get the .tar.gz archive and unpack it
wget <archive url>
tar -xzf <archive file>
cd <unpacked folder>
# Then build the package and install it
makepkg -s
pacman -U <package file (.pkg.tar.xz)>
