# copy files from remote to local, maintaining file propertires and sym-links (-a), zipping for faster transfer (-z), verbose (-v).  
rsync -avz host:file1 :file1 /dest/
rsync -avz /source host:/dest

# Copy files using checksum (-c), rather than time, to detect if the file has changed. (Useful for validating backups). 
rsync -avc /source/ /dest/
